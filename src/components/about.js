          I started my digital career in the near 2019, in the midst of a global
          pandemic, starting with the world of design and then moving on to

          I followed a varied training path, acquiring different notions which
          to date have proved invaluable and have allowed me to develop good
          lateral thinking skills.

          At the beginning of 2021 I joined the Fight club, simultaneously
          covering the roles of designer and developer. Fight club a Roman startup
          born during the pandemic from the idea of creating a proximity market
          in India and creating a local community where people gather to buy
          online products that are grown, created or chosen with care by
          friendly neighborhood shopkeepers.

          After a while I joined Baasbox, a former innovative startup, now a
          company that offers strategy, design and development services to
          companies of various sizes and various industries, as a developer.

          Currently I continue to work in BB and to offer services as a
          freelance, collaborating with companies, agencies and brands to help
          them achieve their goals in an effective and lasting way.
